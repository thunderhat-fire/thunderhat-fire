My Mantra and Ethos -- a short summation for how I design....

Taking a direct approach to giving digital presence to social, economic and political needs of the "free web" movement. Supporting grassroots organisations with creation of web systems - Design | Implementation | Growth.

Focusing on the three pillars that form my work in the Digital Sphere... these are:

Permanence : How to create lasting constructions - whether that be a message, a website or a logo - something that resonates on a level that cuts through the noise of the modern life. Here I try to reflect the values of the organisation or business that I am working for in order to deliver something that is of value to all ( consumers/company)... after all the Digital World is inherently fickle and fashion led - which means in most cases transitional and short lasting. So to create something that has a legacy is a challenge - and one that I relish.

Novelty : It's often said -" they're is nothing new under the sun" - true but slightly depressing a statement, to design and build Novel things whether a website, a video or a Song that is truly novel - is again a challenge, but not something that I willingly shy away from - I think novelty and ingenuity are oft interchangeable - so to use new tools to create Unique designs is certainly possible - but to use existing/old tools to do the same - is well, again a creative challenge.

Value: What value is depends on whom you ask, customer value, organisational value, ecological value? all are value propositions framed by the reference of the environment in which the designed item sits. For a website? I think you can say - it will always be code in some form - but how does that code translate into value for the end user? 

These art/design questions and ethics are issues that delight and frustrate me -- but ultimately lead to a more informed approach to as to how I go about the process of building Digital Communications. #design #growth #organicgrowth  #freeweb
